COVID -19 pandemic in Nigeria was part of the worldwide pandemic of Coronavirus disease 
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS – COV – 2). Nigeria like other 
African countries has had it own share of the impact of the pandemic.
In a nation of more than 200 million people, the impact of the virus in Nigeria has been notably 
overstated globally, with 267,173 confirmed cases; yet, compared to other nations, much fewer 
tests have been conducted for the virus in Nigeria. But there have only been a few deaths 3,155.
Amazingly, a computed 1.18% death rate showed a people determined to tackle hardship headon, placing the country 14th in terms of deaths and demonstrating the fortitude of a people in 
the face of hardship. 
Key points about Nigeria's response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
Despite being one of Africa's most populous nations, Nigeria has shown a relatively low death 
rate from COVID-19, attributed to factors like a warmer climate, younger population, and 
experience with past epidemics like Ebola.
Nigeria's proactive approach to combating the virus, along with joint efforts, resulted in a low 
infection rate of 0.12%, protecting a significant portion of its population.
Nigeria ranked 7th in vaccine distribution efforts, receiving over 3 million vaccinations in January 
2022. A vaccination rate of 1.4% demonstrated determination to overcome the crisis.
Challenges such as inadequate testing capacity and premature easing of lockdown measures 
have posed obstacles to Nigeria's COVID-19 response, despite initial containment efforts.
In summary, Nigeria's experience underscores that larger populations do not necessarily equate 
to higher death rates during pandemics, and proactive measures coupled with international 
cooperation can mitigate the impact of such crises
